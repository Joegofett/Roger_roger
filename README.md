Building a discord bot. Phase one is learning how discord API works so just building out a simple user input of question option 1 option 2 option 3 up to 10 and only running on my computer

Phase 2 will getting it up on an ELB making a seperate way to handle secrets, adding more functionality outside of just polls and more varied polls look into spotify integration

Phase 3 Integrate spotify and create a monthly playist people can add too and create a channel that if people add a song to that channel it gets added to the playlist(scope out how much work for adding options of playlist and creating new playiist)
